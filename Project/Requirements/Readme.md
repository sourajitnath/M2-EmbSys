# Collision Avoidance System (CAS) for Automobiles using Embedded System 

# 1 About CAS

## 1.1 Abstract:
- The study address the problem of slow reaction time to braking by implementing a collision avoidance system tfixed that aids the driver in ensuring safety. 
The system consists of the autonomous car and the collision avoidance system. 
Based on the signal received from the ultrasonic sensor, the micro controller unit sends a signal to the braking unit for applying the brake automatically as per
braking & throttle control logic fed in to the micro controller unit. To avoid the collision between the
vehicles during the period of running conditions and automatically applying the brake by means of actuators, distance measuring sensors & Electronic control module.


## 1.2 Introduction:
- Nowadays, the number of accidents is so high
and uncertain. Accidents causes worst damage. These accidents are mostly caused by delay of
the driver to hit the brake.
- Collision avoidance systems concentrates on advanced ideas
such as pre-crash sensing, an ultrasonic sensor is used to
sense the object in front of the vehicle and gives the signal to
the microcontroller unit.
- Based on the signal received from
the ultrasonic sensor, the microcontroller unit sends a signal
to the braking unit for applying the brake automatically.


## 1.3 Objectives:
- To design an obstacle sensor system. 
- To develop a system that applies to brake at a safety distance.
- To ensure the system responds in real-time 

### 4W's 1H
What - Collision avoidance for ensuring safety.

Why - To avoid accidents.

Where - Used for vehicles.

When - When there is possibility for an accident.

How - Through sensors and control unit.

### Swot Analysis
Strength - Avoids accidents.
Weakness - Sensor failure.
Opportunities - Easy to build.
Threats - If one componants fails system doesn't work.

## 2 Requirements

## 2.1 High level Requirements


- system shall be able to sense the objects through the ultra sonic sensor
-  System shall send the signals from sensor to control unit  
- The control unit shall operate the actuator to control the break pedal or throttle pedal
- system shall avoid the accident

## 2.2 Low level Requirements:

- Sensor shall not send any signals to control unit when there is no object
- The control unit shall stop the control on actuator when there is no object present
