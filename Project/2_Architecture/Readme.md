## 1.2 SENSORS USED
- ### Ultrasonic sensor:
  The ultrasonic sensor is a very low-cost device and has found its application in most areas of autonomous robots and cars. When an ultrasonic sensor is induced with voltage, it generates sound waves that are emitted through the emitter component of the sensor. The generated sound waves are inaudible to humans (frequency of 20Hz to GHz). The waves travel until such length that they are reflected back. The reflected waves are picked up by the receiver component of the sensor.Ultrasonic sensor in this project is used to detect objects and sends controller the distance between the object and the system.
  
- ### Relay :
  Relays are switches that open and close circuits electromechanically or electronically. Relays control one electrical circuit by opening and closing contacts in another circuit. 

- ### Potentiometer: 
  A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.
  
- ### Buzzer:
  A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short).In this project these are used to warn the        driver to apply brake.
  
## 1.3 ACTUATORS

- ### Dc motor:
  Dc motor is used to control the throttle pedal of the system.

## 1.4 MICRO CONTROLLER
- ### Aurdino : 
  This is the main component which controls all the above mentioned parts of our embedded system. This interfaces all the sensors and actuators. 
 
## SUBSYSTEM
- ### Motor Driver:
  Motor driver in this project is used to drive the motors connected to wheels to propel the system.
